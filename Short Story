# Red Rover, Red Rover
## A Short Story by Kristian Ford

__Saturday, 7:00 P.M:__

Fall break is coming to an end, and I’ve spent most of it sprouting roots here on my couch. My friends invited me to Friendsgiving parties and bonfires, but honestly, I needed a break from reality. You ever just need time to reset? That’s how I’ve felt. I’m dreading going back to school, but not for the reasons you’d expect. There are no bullies to worry about, and I’ve got friends I enjoy being around, most of the time. My grades? I’m a solid B student, so that’s not stressing me out either. College isn’t at the forefront of my mind right now; I keep telling myself I’ll figure it out later. The truth is, I don’t want this break to end. I guess you could call me a typical introvert. I need time alone to recharge, to feel like myself, and to enjoy the freedom of doing absolutely nothing.​
There’s a new movie out that I’d like to see before the break ends. I don’t know much about it, other than it’s new, and in this town, that’s enough. We’ve only got one little theater, and when a new movie arrives, everyone hears about it. I’m not that interested in the movie itself, I’m probably more interested in using it as an excuse to ask Riley out. Somewhere dark enough to hide my nerves but casual enough for a first date.
Feeling tired of wasting away in the house, I muster the courage to call her. I march toward the landline, punching in her number with what little confidence I’ve got. 

> “You’ve got this, just ask her,” I tell myself. 
The phone rings. I wait, my nerves starting to creep in. It rings again, and I start melting. Third ring. What was I thinking? This is a mistake. Then her voice hits me. For a moment, it’s like I’ve been punched in the gut and comforted at the same time.
​
> _“Hello?”_ I freeze. Seconds tick by.
> _“Helloooo?”_

Say something, you idiot!

> _“Oh, h-hey Riley! It’s Greg,”_ I stammer, feeling awkward.
> _“Hey, Greg! How are you?”_

Her voice is warm, and I can tell she’s smiling. I relax a bit, my tension fading.

> _“I’m good. Hey, I was wondering if you wanted to see that new movie tonight around 8?”_ 

We live in such a small town, I don’t even need to say which movie. I know she’ll know.

> _“Aww, Greggy, I wish you had asked earlier. I already have plans with Jenny, Lara, and Cam at the bonfire tonight.”_ 

Disappointment __floods__ me.

> _“Oh… right, of course you do,”_ I say, trying to hide my letdown. 
> _“I forgot about the bonfire.”_
> _“I’m really sorry, Greg.”_
> _“It’s okay,”_ I lie. 
> _“I’ll see you around.”_ I hang up quickly, cutting the awkward moment short.
​
> _“Well, that didn’t go as planned,”_ I mutter. 

Glancing down the hallway, I see the soft glow of the TV reflecting off the couch. Mom’s probably pulling an all-nighter at work, so I decide to go see the movie by myself. Maybe I need a distraction. I grab my denim jacket, hat, and keys, and head out.

The sun is setting, casting a periwinkle sky streaked with thin clouds. A cool breeze rustles a few leaves as I walk. My neighbors’ curtains are closed, but I can see the light from their TV. I imagine them gathered around, eating dinner off TV trays, with the dad shouting the wrong answers at Family Feud, a typical semi-Southern family night.
I’m about two blocks from the theater when I notice an older man standing in the street, staring at me. He’s wearing a dusty flannel, worn Levi’s, and muddy boots. He’s not menacing, but he’s staring so intently it’s unsettling. I avoid eye contact, but every time I glance up, he’s still watching me. Feeling a little uneasy, I quicken my pace toward the theater.
Standing in line at the ticket booth, I people-watch. Middle school kids loiter in front of the theater, likely waiting for someone’s mom to pick them up. A few couples stroll by, probably on date night. Finally, it’s my turn. The ticket booth employee, Kevin, according to his nametag, looks like every other bored 16-year-old.
​
> _“One for The Time Traveler’s Mistress, please,”_ I say, cringing at the title.
> _“$8.95.”_
I hand over my debit card, and he prints the ticket.
> _“Enjoy,”_ he mumbles.
> _“Yeah, you too!”_ 

Wait… did I just tell him to enjoy his job? Ugh. Flushed, I head inside, trying to shake off the awkward moment.

The lobby smells like stale, over-buttered popcorn. Life-size cutouts of old Hollywood stars stand near the entrance, and across the way, flashing arcade games sit untouched. I decide to skip the concessions and hand my ticket to the employee, who directs me to theater 2.
I find a seat in the semi-back, settling in to half-watch this predictable chick flick. A few stragglers come in, mostly couples and some loners like me. The best part of the night is the classic _“Let’s all go to the lobby”_ preview. The movie is laughably bad, predictable and boring. I nod off a few times, and before I know it, it’s over. As the lights come up, I stretch, feeling the satisfying crack and pop of my joints, then head out with the rest of the crowd.

The sky outside is a deep, inky blur of blue and purple. The middle schoolers are gone, and the night is quieter now. As I walk home, I spot the same old man standing in the street again, but this time, he’s facing me. He’s not moving. My heart starts racing. Something about this feels wrong.

> _“Hello… sir? Can I help you?”_ I call out, slowing my pace. 

No response. It’s just the two of us under the gloomy night sky. My heart pounds as I pick up my pace, heading home without looking back. Even though he’s not following, I can still feel his eyes on me.
I reach home and see Mom’s car. She must be back early from work. I rush inside, locking the door behind me, letting out a sigh of relief. After a quick check through the window, I see he’s gone. Thank God. I head upstairs, skipping the creaky step, and fall into bed. I shoot Riley a quick text about the lame movie and then start my nightly routine: shower, brush teeth, scroll Instagram, sleep.

__Sunday, 9:30 A.M.:__

My alarm wakes me with its loud buzzing. Irritated, I turn it off and grab my phone. Riley texted me back. There’s no better feeling than waking up to a message from that special someone. For me, Riley has been that someone ever since we met in Mr. Keele’s 10th-grade biology class. I don’t know how I missed her before that day. She walked in, practically beaming with sunshine. Her long, brassy brown hair swayed as she moved. She sat right in front of me and rummaged through her backpack. A strand of hair fell across her face, and when she tucked it behind her ear, I noticed three cute little piercings. She turned to me, asking to borrow a pencil, mechanical, not regular; regular pencils hurt her fingers. I remember she smelled like sunflowers and Skittles, and I knew she was something special.
​
I open her text: 
> _"You saw the movie without me!? LOL Sorry your night sucked, talk in the AM. Byeee :-)"_
​
Her little smiley emoji makes me grin. I can hear her high-pitched _“Byeee”_ in my head. I decide to text her back after my morning jog.

I throw on a muscle T-shirt and shorts, brush my teeth, and grab my headphones, starting up a running playlist from Spotify. After a few warm-up stretches, I’m off. The sun is shining through the trees, birds are chirping, and the fresh smell of cut grass fills the air.
Jogging down the street, I see Mr. Jenkins outside washing his brand-new 2019 Ford Mustang in candy apple red. I remember how proud he was of his silver ‘63 Corvette, practically giving everyone in the neighborhood a test drive around the block. I wave to him, but he just stares at me, completely still. No expression, just staring. The water from the hose is pouring down the curb, but he doesn't seem to notice. 

> _“Um… okay,”_ I mutter. 

Weird, but I keep jogging. About a house and a half later, I stop to re-tie my shoe. I look back, and Mr. Jenkins is walking toward me. He left the hose running in the street. Perplexed, I continue jogging. Maybe he just decided to go for a walk, too. No big deal, right?
Further down the street, I pass Mrs. Lacey, who’s tending to her vegetable garden. Out of curiosity, I glance back to see if Mr. Jenkins is still following me. Now, Mrs. Lacey and Mr. Jenkins are both staring at me, and holding hands. I stop, almost laughing, and ask, 

> _“Hey, y’all, what’s going on?”_

They don’t respond. They just keep walking toward me, eyes fixed. A strange feeling creeps into the pit of my stomach. I start running again, glancing back every few seconds. Each time I pass someone, they join the group, holding hands, staring at me.
Mrs. Ramos. Ms. Johnson. 

> _“What do you want?!”_ I shout. 

Mr. Carpenter. Mr. Donahue. 

> _“Why are you doing this?!”_

Mr. O'Reilly. Each person joins in, walking behind me in eerie silence. Are they possessed? That’s a thing, right? I’m terrified of what will happen if they catch me. Why is this happening?
I’m running out of breath when __BAM!__ I’m suddenly on my back, under the old oak tree. Warm liquid trickles down my forehead. Every time I blink, the world gets darker, and stars dance before my eyes.

__Sunday, 9:30 A.M.:__

I sit __straight up__ in bed, gasping for air. My alarm is buzzing, and I’m drenched in sweat. 

> _“Woah! What happened?”_

I turn off the alarm and touch my head where I’d been struck in the dream. There’s nothing unusual. No blood. 

> _“What a weird dream.”_

I rush to the mirror to check for bruises, but there’s nothing. It had to have been a dream, a very strange one.
I pick up my phone to check my notifications. There’s a text from Riley: 

> _"You saw the movie without me!? LOL Sorry your night sucked, talk in the AM. Byeee :-)"_

Wait, that’s the same text from my dream. Is this a coincidence? Maybe my brain’s trying to tell me to stop obsessing over her. Brains do that, <ins>right?</ins> They reveal unconscious thoughts or something? It’s weird, but I can’t let it ruin my day. I put my phone down and start getting ready for my jog.

I decide to skip the warm-up stretches and run without music this time. That dream really messed with me, and I need a clear head. I focus on my breathing and start my usual route. I’m coming up on Mr. Jenkins’ house when I see him… washing his car. No way. Calm down, Greg. Two coincidences don’t mean anything; I’ll just go talk to him. That’ll change things up.
I slow down as I approach, stopping a few feet from him. 

> _“Mr. J, you’ll never believe the dream I had last night. I dreamt you were out here washing your car just like you are now. Isn’t that something?”_ I laugh, trying to mask my nerves. 

Mr. Jenkins looks up, and suddenly, his face goes blank. His eyes, there’s something wrong. They look like TV static. But… how? 

> _“Mr. J, are you okay? Your eyes look kind of funny.”_

His arms drop, and he starts walking toward me, emotionless but determined. I step back. __He’s close now.__

> _“I… I’m sorry to bother you!”_ I shout, taking off running. 

What is going on? I glance back, and Mr. Jenkins has dropped the hose and is following me, faster than in my dream. __Screw this__, I’m going home. I cut through Mrs. Clark’s backyard, hopping her fence. She’s sitting on her porch swing, sipping sweet tea. 

> _“Sorry, Mrs. Clark!”_ I yell, apologizing for intruding. 

Just as I’m about to jump the fence on the other side, I look back and see she’s walking toward me, too, eyes just like Mr. Jenkins’.
What the hell is going on? I hop the fence and sprint. Who knows how many of them are following me now?
I make it back to the sidewalk leading to my house. I turn and see my neighbors, all holding hands, following me. They’re walking faster this time. I’m out of breath, so I stop to catch it. The crowd is getting closer. 

> _“What do you people want?!”_ I shout. 

No answer. Just cold, staticky stares. 

> _“F-fuck,”_ I whisper, gasping for air. 

__They’re too close.__ As I turn, a car pulls out of its driveway and hits me with such force that I’m sent flying into the street. The pain is excruciating. I can’t move. They’re circling around me, getting closer and closer. The world fades to black.

__Sunday, 9:30 A.M.:__

The buzzing wakes me again. I open my eyes and stare at the ceiling. Was it another dream? I roll over to check my phone. Sunday. __How is it still Sunday?__ 

> _“No, no, no… NO!”_

How is this happening? I’ve already lived this day. 

> _“What the __FUCK__ is going on?!”_
